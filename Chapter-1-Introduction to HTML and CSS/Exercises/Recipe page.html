<h2 class="heading2style">Method</h2>
<ol>  <!--This is a ol tag that numbers the steps to prepare the pizza-->
    <li>Prepare pizza dough. If using store-bought frozen pizza dough, make sure it's thawed.</li><br> <!--The br tag is used to break the text-->
    <li>Preheat oven to 246°C (475°F). Allow it to heat for at least 15-20 minutes as you shape the pizza in the next step. 
        Lightly grease a large baking sheet or pizza pan with 1/2 Tablespoon of olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with cornmeal, 
        which gives the crust extra crunch and flavor.</li><br>
    <li>When the homemade dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles. 
        Divide the dough in half and freeze half the dough for another time. 
        On a lightly floured work surface using lightly floured hands or rolling pin, gently flatten the dough into a disc. 
        Place on prepared pan and, using lightly floured hands, stretch and flatten the disc into a 12-inch circle, about 1/2-inch thick.</li><br>
    <li>If the dough keeps shrinking back as you try to stretch it, stop what you're doing, cover it lightly and let it rest for 5-10 minutes, 
        then try again. Once shaped into a 12-inch circle, lift the edge of the dough up to create a lip around the edges. 
        Simply pinch the edges up to create the rim. Cover dough lightly with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow to rest for 
        a few minutes as you gather the pizza toppings.</li><br>
    <li>Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Brush remaining olive oil all over the dough. 
        Top the dough evenly with 1/3 cup (about 95g) BBQ sauce. Toss the cooked chicken with the remaining BBQ sauce, 
        then scatter all around the pizza. Add the cheeses and red onion.</li><br>
    <li>Bake for 14-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Remove from the oven.</li><br>
    <li>Slice the hot pizza, serve and enjoy!</li>
